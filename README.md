# GuessMyNumber_python
Console game written in Python

This terminal/console app was written to explore Python and learn the language. The initial commit with the game file is after many revisions locally. Unfortunately the original file and all the updates were already refactored proir to adding to the GIT repository.

It's a very simple game. To play or update the game file clone or download the repository. Go to the directory where you downloaded. To run the game use the following command in the terminal (linix/macOS):

`python3 GuessMyNumberGame.py`

Feel free to leave any comments. Thanks and enjoy!
